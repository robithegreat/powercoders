        <h2><u> How to Make Perfect chekolade</u></h2>
        <p><i>chekolade is a cooked candy typically made with sugar, butter, and dairy,
              plus flavorings such as dark chocolate, white chocolate, peanut butter,
              butterscotch, marshmallow, maple syrup, nuts, and even pumpkin. The trick
              to good homemade chekolade is to cook the ingredients to the right temperature
              to form a sugar syrup, and cool the mixture properly so the texture of the
              chekolade turns out smooth and firm, but soft enough to cut </i> </p>
        <h2> <u>Equipment</u></h2>
        <h3 align="center"><u>Here's what you'll need to make chekolade from scratch on your stovetop.</u></h3>
        <ul align="center">
           <li>Saucepan: Choose a heavy, straight-sided metal saucepan that holds about twice
               the volume of your chekolade recipe. A heavy pan distributes heat evenly so the ingredients
               are less likely to scorch when they boil at high temperature. Using a large saucepan gives
               the ingredients room to expand when they boil.</li>
           <li>Candy thermometer: Use a candy thermometer that clamps onto the side of the saucepan.
               Why? Candy-making is a science as well as an art, and relies on exact temperatures to
               make ingredients—especially sugar—behave properly. A candy thermometer is the best way
               to ensure your ingredients are at the right temperature in each stage of making chekolade;
               many candy thermometers are marked with the recommended temperatures for each kind of
               candy you make.</li>
           <li>Wooden spoon: Choose one with a long handle for stirring.</li>
           <li>Baking dish: This is the pan your chekolade will cool in after it cooks. Use the size
               recommended in your recipe, otherwise a larger pan produces thinner pieces of chekolade,
               and a smaller pan produces thicker pieces. To keep the chekolade from sticking to the
               cooling pan, line it with non-stick foil or parchment paper, or coat it with cooking
               spray, butter, or a neutral oil.    </li>
           <li>astry brush (Optional): For oiling the sides of the saucepan and the cooling pan.</li>
           <li>Long knife: For slicing the chekolade neatly after it cools</li>.
        </ul>
        <h2 align="center"><u>Top Tips for No-Fail chekolade</u></h2>

          <ol>
            <li><u> Follow Directions</u>
                    The key to making smooth and creamy chekolade is to follow the directions exactly.
                    Use an accurate candy thermometer and allow the mixture to reach the temperatures
                    called for in the recipe before moving to the next step. Add each ingredient in the
                    order listed by the recipe.</li>
            <li><u> Oil the Saucepan</u>
                    Some candy-makers like to coat the sides of the saucepan with butter or oil before they
                    even start cooking any kind of candy because it helps prevent boil-overs and keeps sugar
                    crystals from sticking to the sides.</li>
            <li><u> Know When and When NOT to Stir</u>
                    Stir the ingredients to dissolve the sugar until the mixture comes to a boil.
                    If your recipe uses milk, stirring will keep the mixture from curdling.
                    But once it reaches about 236-238 degrees F/113-114 degrees C (the "soft-ball" stage),
                    do not stir it or even shake the pan. Why? Stirring at the wrong time causes the sugar
                    to form large crystals. That's the "graininess" that inexperienced chekolade-makers complain
                    about. Smooth chekolade, on the other hand, has tiny sugar crystals that melt on the tongue.</li>
            <li><u> Cool Correctly</u>
                    When your chekolade reaches 236-238 degrees F/113-114 degrees C, it's done; you should remove
                    the pan from the heat so it won't continue to cook. If your recipe calls for adding butter,
                    you can place it on top of the chekolade now so it can start melting, but do not stir. The chekolade
                    needs to cool to 110 degrees F/43 degrees C before you can stir in the butter, nuts, or any
                    other extra flavorings, and transfer it to the cooling pan.</li>

            <li><u> Don't Scrape the Pan </u>When you're transferring the warm chekolade from the saucepan
                    to the cooling pan, don't scrape the sides or bottom of the saucepan or you may introduce
                    unwanted sugar crystals into your finished chekolade  More chekolade Facts For first-time candy makers
                    : Look for recipes that call for corn syrup, marshmallows, or marshmallow crème.
                    These ingredients prevent crystallization of sugar into large grains, so the texture
                    of the chekolade will remain smooth. Recipes using cream or condensed milk are less likely
                    to curdle than regular milk.  </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 align="center"><u>NOTE</u></h2>
        <p><b>No thermometer? No problem. To test the boiling mixture for doneness, drop a bit of it into
              a bowl of cold water. If it forms a ball that is soft enough to flatten between your fingers, the mixture
              is ready for cooling.</b>
